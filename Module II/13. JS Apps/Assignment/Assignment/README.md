##  Assignment

Create a SPA application for working with learning materials. Each material has **title**, **description**, optional **img**. Registered users can leave comments on materials and add materials to their profile in a categoty **want-to-watch**, **watched** or **watching**

### Users pages/functionality

- **Users** can **Register**, **Login** and **Logout** in the application
  - Users provide `username`  and `password`
- **All users** (even not logged in) can
  - **View** other users profile page
  - **View** list of materials, that are created by any user
    - The `title`, `createdOn`, `description` and `img` are shown
    - Clicking on a `title` should take the user to the details page of that material
  - **Search** by `title`, `user` or `description`
  - **View** all comments of a material
  - **View** their and other users profile page
  - **View** the details page of the material
    - Shows the `title`, full `description`, `img`, `username` of the creator of the material and a list with all comments
      - Clicking on the `username` (who created the material) should open that user's profile page (`#/users/:username`)
- **Registered and Logged-in users** can:
  - **Have** a profile page on `/users/:username`
  - **Create** a new material
    - Providing `title`, `description` and optionally `img`
  - **Leave** comments on existing materials
    - Prodiving `commentText`
  - Assign a **Status** to a material
  	 - Status can be `want-to-watch`, `watched`, `watching`

### User Profile pages/functionality

- Shows the current users details by username
- Show `want-to-watch`, `watched`, `watching` and lists materials in that state for the current user

### Materials pages/functionality

- **View all materials**
  - List all materials from the server
- **Search materials**
  - **View only filtered materials** that contain the **search phrase**
  - Redirects to **Search results page**
- **Details page**:
  - Shows the `title`, full `description`, `user`, `img` and list with all comments
  	 - Clicking on the `user` should open that user's profile page (`#/users/:username`)
  - Logged-in users can assign a **Status** to a material
  	 - Status can be `want-to-watch`, `watched` or `watching`

## Application routes

Implement at least the following routes in your app:

- `#/`
  - Redirects to `#/home`
- `#/home`
  - Shows all materials
  - Available to all users, logged-in or not
- `#/home?filter=XXXXXX` or `#/home/XXXXXX`
  - Shows the materials that match the search phrase in the _Search Page_
  - Available to all users, logged-in or not
- `#/materials/:id`
  - Shows the materials the _Details page_ of the material with the provided `id`, with full description
      - Logged in users only should be able to change the status of the material (`want-to-watch`, `watched`, `watching`)
  - Available to all users, logged-in or not
- `#/profiles/:username`
  - Shows the profile of user with the `username` passed in the URL
  - `#/profiles/john` should show the profile of the user `john`
  - Available to all users, logged-in or not

**Other routes are also OK. You are not limited to only the routes above** 

## Server routes
See the [SERVER_ROUTES.md](./SERVER_ROUTES.md) file

## Data object

- Create a data object containing methods for each operation to the server
  - _Examples:_
    - `data.getMaterials()` to get all materials
    - `data.login(username, password)` to login users
    - And more...

## Unit tests

- Write unit tests with Mocha, Chai and Sinon for each method of the `data` object
  - Test if the methods work correctly with correct data
  - Test if the methods throw/return approriate exceptions/results

## Application requirements

**Mandatory** provide a good **User Experience(UX)**
  - No need to be pretty, just usable
    - Design the application in an intuitive way, so that your colleagues aren't confused how to use and test your application

**Mandatory** use extensively the following libraries:

- jQuery
  - For AJAX
  - For DOM manipulation
- Handlebars.js
  - For view templates

**Do NOT** use any of the following:
- AngularJS
- KendoUI framework
  - Data-binding, routing, ViewModels, etc...
- Durandal
- Backbone.js
- Ember.js
- Batman.js

You can use libraries for:
- Notifications
  - toastr or any other
- UI components
  - jQueryUI, KendoUI UI components, Twitter Bootstrap
- Utils frameworks:
  - Moment, Underscore/Lodash
  - Libs for encryption
  - etc...
- Routers
- Module loading

## Starting the node server
  1. Restore the packages by running `npm install` in this directory.
  1. Run `npm start`. You should see a message `App running at http://localhost:3001/` in the terminal.
  - _Hint_: the server stores the data in `db/localDb.json`. You can look there :)

## Deliverables - **read carefully!**
- **ZIP (no rars)**, all your code, including the server
  - **Remove the `node_modules` and `bower_components` folder**
  - **Make sure that you have a `package.json` and a `bower.json` file in the root directory of your application**
    - If you don't, you can run `npm init` and/or `bower init` - this will create the files
      - Don't forget to edit your name out of both files.
  - **If you install packages with `bower` or `npm`, do not forget to add `--save` to the end of the install command**
    - _Example_: `bower install jqueryui --save`
    - **This is required so your colleagues can restore the packages you installed and run your application!!**
- Send the **ZIP** file on the page, provided at https://telerikacademy.com

## Constraints and validation
- Implement client-side validation in your application. In case a validation fails, notify the user with an appropriate message. **The only validations necessary are described below. Other validations are not required**.
- **User**
  - **username**
      - A string
      - Has length between 6 and 30
      - Can contain only Latin letters, digits and the characters '\_' and '.'
  - **password**
      - A string
      - Has length between 6 and 30
      - Can contain only Latin letters, digits
- **Material**
  - **title**
      - A string
      - Has length between 6 and 100
      - Can contain any characters
  - **description**
      - A string
      - Has no length restrictions
      - Can contain any characters
