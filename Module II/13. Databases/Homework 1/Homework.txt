In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding 
documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification 
and several other related specifications,all of them free open standards—define XML.

XML is a universal format for structured documents and data on the web. In other words, 
it is used to markup or describe data.
Since XML stores data in plain text format, the storage is independent of your platform and 
your data can be exported, imported, or simply moved much easier.

XML namespaces are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes in an XML document. 
They are defined in a W3C recommendation.[1][2] An XML instance may contain element or attribute 
names from more than one XML vocabulary. If each vocabulary is given a namespace, the ambiguity 
between identically named elements or attributes can be resolved.
XML Namespaces provide a method to avoid element name conflicts.
