1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
- A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.
- A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.

- 	SELECT - extracts data from a database
	UPDATE - updates data in a database
	DELETE - deletes data from a database
	INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
	CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
	ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
	CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
	ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
	DROP TABLE - deletes a table
	CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
	DROP INDEX - deletes an index

2. What is Transact-SQL

- Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases.

T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.
