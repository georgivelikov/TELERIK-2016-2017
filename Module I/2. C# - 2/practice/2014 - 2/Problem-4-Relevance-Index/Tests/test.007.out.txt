only you ignore the CAPITALSEARCH casing and treat it like a CAPITALSEARCH or a CAPITALSEARCH or a CAPITALSEARCH
BECAUSE A CAPITAL SEARCH is like a search of a CAPITALSEARCH which is not the same as capital search but is the same as CAPITALSEARCH and CAPITALSEARCH
if so where is the SEARCH of a CAPITAL which is a CAPITALSEARCH CAPITALSEARCH
DO YOU HAVE CAPITAL for a CAPITALSEARCH
