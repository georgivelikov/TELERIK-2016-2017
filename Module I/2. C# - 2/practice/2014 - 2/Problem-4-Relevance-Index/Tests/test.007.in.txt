DO YOU HAVE CAPITAL for a capitalSEARCH?
if so where is the SEARCH of a CAPITAL, which is a capitalsearch capitalsearch
BECAUSE A CAPITAL?SEARCH is like a search of a CaPiTaLsEaRcH which is not the same as capital search but is the same as capitalsearch and CAPITALSEARCH
only you ignore the CAPITALSEARCH casing and treat it like a cApItAlSeArCh or a CAPitALsearch or a capitalseaRCH
